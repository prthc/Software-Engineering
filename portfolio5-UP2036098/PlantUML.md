### ExampleUseCase.png

![ExampleUseCase.png][1]

This ExampleUseCase.png image is the original diagram generated by PlantUML.

### GeneratingExampleUseCase.png

![GeneratingExampleUseCase.png][2]

This image shows how ExampleUseCase.png image is generated using the command line with "plantuml Diagram.puml -tpng -output images" and adding it in the images folder.

### ExampleUseCase900.png

![ExampleUseCase900.png][3]

In this diagram, I have changed the resolution by adding "skinparam dpi 900" to the second diagram contents. Comparing to the original diagram, this diagram is more clearer even after zooming in the image has high resolution image.

### ExampleUseCase900Resolution.png

![ExampleUseCase900Resolution.png][4]

To know the resolution of the second image, "plantuml Diagram.puml -v" were executed in the commandline. The image has 3243x2446 dimension which is bigger then the original image with 346x261 dimension only. As we can see there is huge difference in both of this image.

### ExampleUseCase.svg

![ExampleUseCase.svg][5]

This image is generated as svg image with the PlantUML commandline "plantuml Diagram.puml -tsvg -output images" and adding it to images folder. Since svg images are describe a line as having a start and stop location and then describe the line, it has better quality comparing to the png image generated by PlantUML.

### ExampleUseCase900.svg

![ExampleUseCase900.svg][6]

Same as the previous image, svg has better quality even when zooming in depth. The difference between this two images can be seen clearly because the png image shows pixels of colours and svg image does not.
