## Getting started

If you are reading this, then you have created your private repository and are ready to start the tasks below to complete Portfolio1.

## Submission process

This GitHub repository is your private repository and this is where all parts of
the Portfolio submission **must** get committed. You should be familiar with Git and
GitHub.

In this Portfolio you will clone this repository, add/change/delete the existing Markdown (`*.md`)
files and commit changes back to this GitHub repository.

You should commit frequently and push changes to this github repository often
(At least once per day that you work on this Portfolio).

This repository will automatically be copied for marking at the deadline.

There are multiple parts to this Portfolio, all parts must be completed.

If you include a figure/image/diagram, it must be committed to this repository.
(Preferably in the images folder). Only images that are visible in the Markdown
files will be marked. This means that you must add the image to your Markdown
file.

If you use an external program to generate images (e.g. Paint, Visio,PowerPoint) you
may wish to store the images in the source format in an appropriately named
sub-folder (e.g. ImageSource or Binary)

## Recommended workflow

1. Download (clone/pull) files from this GitHub repository.

2. Edit the Markdown files in a text editor.

3. Save (git commit) your files to your git repository (frequently!)

4. Push (git push) your commits to GitHub as often as you want!
(Only the files saved in the GitHub repository will be marked)

5. When you think you are done, [double check](#when-you-are-ready-to-submit).

## When you are ready to submit

If you think you are complete, ***STOP*** and double check.

* As part of this portfolio you probably generated images/diagrams/figures.

  * These files should be committed to GitHub.
  * They **must** be linked into a Markdown file for the relevant task.

* You may have forgotten to push your commits (You committed locally but did not
  push to GitHub). **Only the Markdown files in GitHub will be marked**.

## P1.1 Login

Ensure that you are logged into GitHub using your university email. If you are
unsure, select settings from the GitHub.com dropdown in the top right-hand corner.

* Your GitHub username must be your Student ID (e.g. UP1234567)
  * This includes the letters "UP"
  * UP is case sensitive

In the email section ensure that your @myport.ac.uk is listed.

> If you are not logged in with a Portsmouth account you need to change this
before proceeding.

1. Please logout of GitHub.com.
2. Create an account (If you do not have one) with your Portsmouth student
   email.
3. Delete any cloned repository that was generated using your incorrect GitHub
    account.
4. Select the link from the assessments section of
   [Moodle](https://moodle.port.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=11429). (To generate a
   new repository)

When you have completed this Portfolio task, confirm your progress by completing the [checklist](#portfolio-checklist).

* Put an `X` in the checklist to indicate the task is complete
* Commit your changes to Git
* Push your changes to GitHub.com

## P1.2 Install some Git tooling

You should be familiar with Git and GitHub. You need to be able to checkout this
repository, make changes, commit changes and push these changes to github.com.

The tooling is your choice. Please use the tools with which you are familiar.
P1.2 requires that you refresh your knowledge of Git tooling and ensure that your
can complete all the steps required to make changes to this repository.

The following tooling is recommended.

### Git tools

* [**Recommended:  Github desktop** https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) (Mac/Windows)
* [**Alternative:** Git command line https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) (Mac/Windows)
* [**Alternative:** Git for Windows https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/) (Windows)
* You may wish to consider the Windows Subsystem for Linux. You can install Linux tools on a windows shell.
[https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)

> TIP: Try a checkout, edit, commit, push using the command line only.

When you have completed this Portfolio task, confirm your progress by completing the [checklist](#portfolio-checklist).

* Put an `X` in the checklist to indicate the task is complete
* Commit your changes to Git

## P1.3 Install an editor

Markdown files have the extension `.md`. These are just text files and can be
edited by any text editor.

If you are unfamiliar with Markdown please watch this video:

### Markdown editor

You can choose any editor. Be sure to pick one that:

* reloads files if they are updated externally (e.g. when your pull updates a file that
is open).
* supports linux/windows file endings

You may want to consider installing a Markdown editor:

* [**Recommended:** Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
(Windows/Mac/Linux)
  * Install one of the Markdown extensions [https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown)
  * A Spell checker is handy [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

* [**Alternative:** Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) (Windows/Mac/Linux)
  * [Instructions and setup for Atom if you have a **Chromebook**](https://blog.atom.io/2018/10/02/running-atom-on-chome-os.html)

* Commit and Push your new file to GitHub.com

> TIP: Your file must be visible when you load the github.com repo webpage.

When you have completed this Portfolio task, confirm your progress by completing the [checklist](#portfolio-checklist).

* Put an `X` in the checklist to indicate the task is complete
* Commit your changes to Git

## P1.5 Edit your Markdown file

Open your Markdown file (e.g. UP1234567.md) and add these three **headings**:

* My preferred programming language is...
* My preferred operating system is...
* My favorite animal is...

> TIP: If you commit your `.md` you should get an automatically generated PDF/html file in the `build\` folder.

Beneath each **heading** add a one line answer.
Commit your changes and push to github.com

* Add an image of your favorite animal beneath your answer

> TIP: you should have a minimum of two commits for this file
(one creating an empty file and; one adding the content)
