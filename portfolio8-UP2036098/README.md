## Git commands

So far you have learnt the following git commands, if you are unclear what these are you MUST practice. You are expected to know them and how to use them without explanation.

```shell
git clone
git add
git pull
git commit
git push
git branch
git merge
git checkout
```

And your trusted command, to help figure what is going on....

```shell
git status
```

> Your repository will be copied for marking automatically at the deadline.
> EDITS after the deadline are automatically ignored.

When you update the `CheckList.md` file. This will trigger an action to inspect the work for this part of the Portfolio.(You can also manually run the `PortfolioChecker` if you need to see if changes solve any errors)

Files, external to this repo and any images imported via URL will be ignored (Even if they are stored in GitHub).

Large blocks of text that use the 'CODE' formatting will be ignored. This includes using triple \`\`\` (Unless it is code or something sensible).
If it looks like you are using \`\`\` to contain Markdown to avoid the lint checker, it will be ignored.
Code blocks should be labeled with the code language so that the syntax highlighter is enabled.

Here is a helpful Markdown link: [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)

At no point in this Assessment should you use the `Add file` button on the GitHub webpage -- Pretend it does not exist

Marking is performed on a Ubuntu machine. This means that everything is case sensitive, where it may not be on Windows.

> Clone, Edit, Commit, Push  (Preferably on the command line)

## Objectives

* Learn how to use LFS (Large file support)  in GitHub

## Portfolio 8 Part 1

Create a file with the filename `Student.id`, add your Student ID to the content of this file. Note:

* Invalid ID = No marks
* The file extension is `.id` other file extensions e.g. `.txt` are not permitted
* The content of the file should be your ID ONLY, e.g. `UP1234567`
* You may have a return character at the end of the line `\n` (Note this is not two ASCII text characters)
* You need the `UP`
* Filename is case sensitive
* File contents are case sensitive
* File should contain one line of text only
* Markdown formatting is NOT permitted e.g. `*` or `-`

> Instructions are slightly different this time, please follow the instructions.

## Portfolio 8 Part 2

For this portfolio it is important that you learn how to use git LFS to store large files.

For `Portfolio8` it is important that you use **small files** in place of large files. If you use large files , then it wastes bandwidth, storage and more importantly will become slow.

`Portfolio8` will ensure you have the skills to submit your `CW4` video as this will need LFS support. (You only get one chance to upload your video, so practice in this `Portfolio8` repo first)

Read the following so that you understand what git LFS is and why you would use it.

* [https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage)

* [https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/collaboration-with-git-large-file-storage](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/collaboration-with-git-large-file-storage)

## Portfolio 8 Part 3

In order to use `git lfs`, you'll need to download and install a new program that is separate from Git.
Install `git lfs` support for your operating system, see these instructions:

[https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage)

Here are some examples:

### Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo apt install git-lfs
$
```

### Windows

[https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v2.13.2/git-lfs-windows-v2.13.2.exe](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v2.13.2/git-lfs-windows-v2.13.2.exe)

> Check you have lfs installed

```bash
$ git lfs version
git-lfs/2.13.2 (GitHub; linux amd64; go 1.15.5)
```

1. Add a new markdown file to your `.pandoc.yml`
2. Add your `git lfs version` output text to the markdown file, add it to the .pandoc.yml. Use fenced code.

```text

a bit like this

```

## Portfolio 8 Part 4

[https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

* Once downloaded and installed, set up Git LFS for your user account by running:

```bash
git lfs install
```

> You only need to run this **once per user account**.

In each Git repository where you want to use Git LFS (e.g. `Portfolio8` and `CW4`) associate a file type in your repository with Git LFS. Enter `git lfs track` followed by the name of the file extension you want to automatically upload to Git LFS.

> You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.

* For Portfolio8 , associate any file with the `.largefile` extension with Git LFS. (If you run Windows, ensure you can see file extensions). Here is the command:

`git lfs track "*.largefile"`

> This will generate a `.gitattributes` file, which you can edit manually if you want.

Make sure the file `.gitattributes` will be versioned with git. E.g. add the file to your git repo:

`git add .gitattributes`

Note that defining the file types Git LFS should track will not, by itself, convert any pre-existing files to Git LFS, such as files on other branches or in your prior commit history. To do that, use the git lfs migrate command, which has a range of options designed to suit various potential use cases.

* Add the contents of your `.gitattributes` to your `Portfolio8` PDF, consider fenced code and a heading.

From now on any file with the extension `.largefile` will be managed by LFS. For your `CW4` you will need to do this for your Video submission.

> If you run `git lfs track` without any options it will show you what files are being tracked by LFS.

## Portfolio 8 Part 5

Generate a file (Do not make it bigger that 1KiB) name the file: `Test1.largefile`. For those on windows be careful with extensions here.

Add this file to git; commit and push
Here is an example:

```bash
$ echo "Hello large file" > Testing.largefile
$ git add Testing.largefile
$ git commit -m "Adding a LFS file"
$ git push
$
```

Copy the text output of your command line to your `Portfolio8` PDF. It must contain a line showing that an LFS object is being uploaded. Consider a heading; fenced code.

Here is an example output from a git push using LFS:

```bash
$ git push
Uploading LFS objects: 100% (1/1), 5 B | 0 B/s, done.
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 357 bytes | 357.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.

## Portfolio 8 Part 6

> Storing large files in git is often a bad idea, but everyone gets tempted and hence it is worth knowing how to do it properly.

Read the notes on bandwidth and storage

[https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage)

Beware that your `CW4` limits will enable you to upload your video **once**. Use this repo to ensure you have a good understanding of LFS. Feel free to practice (using small files).

Take note of this :

*If you push a 500 MB file to Git LFS, you'll use 500 MB of your allotted storage and none of your bandwidth. If you make a 1 byte change and push the file again, you'll use another 500 MB of storage and no bandwidth, bringing your total usage for these two pushes to 1 GB of storage and zero bandwidth.*

* Add a list of the files tracked by LFS (probably one) to your `Portfolio8` PDF. Here is an example:

```bash
$ git lfs ls-files
f2ca1bb6c7 * test.mp4
$
```
