# Project Overview

MoodMe is a mobile application designed to assist individuals struggling with maintaining good mental health during their recovery process. The main goal of the app is to provide a tool for users to track their mood on a 1 to 10 scale and set reminders for themselves throughout the day. The primary data stored by the app is user-generated and is visualized in a line graph to help the user understand their recovery pattern and track their progress.

The app offers several features, including a "diary" tab where users can write down their thoughts in either a custom format or by using a standard questionnaire provided by the app. The user can also set daily tasks or specific goals and mark them as complete at any time of the day. Progress reports can be viewed in tandem with the graphs, showing the user's overall mood throughout selected periods of time.

At the end of each week, the system generates an "end of week report" displaying average mood, average percentage of tasks completed, and data collected from the diary questionnaires. The report compares these statistics against the previous week, providing the user with a better understanding of their progress.

The app has an optional feature that sends the user a notification if it detects a declining pattern in their mood or average task completion, offering external help via traditional wellbeing services such as Samaritans. This option is turned off by default to avoid overwhelming the user and potentially affecting their mental health in a negative way.

The target audience for MoodMe is anyone who is struggling with poor mental health or wishes to track their progress towards better mental health, such as students or other individuals experiencing stress during the current climate.

To develop MoodMe, the team will be using the SCRUM model, which allows for the design, development, and testing of multiple versions of the app before releasing the final version. As the project evolves, new features may be added, making SCRUM an ideal model for this project.

## The need of MoodMe application

There is growing evidence of the need for mental health apps, particularly due to the increasing rates of mental health issues globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.

Research has shown that mental health apps can have a positive impact on various mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research found that digital interventions, including mobile apps, can improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. The study analyzed 28 randomized controlled trials that involved a total of 3,369 participants.

Another study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that a mobile app designed to improve mood and reduce anxiety was effective in reducing symptoms of both conditions. The study involved 88 participants who used the app for four weeks.

Moreover, the use of mental health apps has increased significantly in recent years, indicating a growing demand for such tools. A report by Research and Markets found that the mental health app market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.3% from 2020 to 2027. The report cites factors such as increasing rates of mental health disorders, the growing popularity of smartphones and wearable devices, and the need for more accessible and convenient mental health care.
